## Database schema (public)

| Table           | Key columns                                                                                                   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Upserted via `upsert_osm_courts()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

DB triggers block post-start edits and un-cancellation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `friendships`   | requester_id + addressee_id (composite PK), status ('pending'\|'accepted'), accepted_at                       | Directional pair so we know who asked whom. Unordered-pair UNIQUE index blocks A→B/B→A coexistence. RLS: anon SELECT of accepted rows powers public friend lists; only addressee can flip pending→accepted; either party can DELETE. Triggers: P0004/P0005/P0006 + accepted_at auto-stamp + party immutability. |

## Key patterns

- **Hand-maintained TS types** in `src/lib/database.types.ts` — keep in sync with migrations.
- **RLS + triggers** — RLS enforces ownership; triggers enforce business logic (session cap, edit guards).
- **Debounced Overpass sync** — map pan/zoom fetches courts from Overpass, upserts via RPC, per-bbox cache prevents duplicate queries.
- **Sanitized client-to-server** — Overpass data validated + truncated before RPC call.
- **Optimistic UI** — useProfile applies updates optimistically, reverts on error.
- **PG error codes** — `P0001` = SESSION_FULL, `P0002` = SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE, `P0003` = USERNAME_GENERATION_FAILED, `P0004` = FRIENDSHIP_SELF, `P0005` = FRIENDSHIP_DUPLICATE (reverse pair exists), `P0006` = FRIENDSHIP_IMMUTABLE.
- **Centralized error mapping** — `friendlyMessage()` in `src/lib/errors.ts` converts raw Supabase/Postgres errors to user-friendly strings. All error call sites use this instead of `error.message`.
- **SECURITY DEFINER triggers** — `enforce_session_cap()`, `upsert_osm_courts()`, `add_host_to_session_rsvps()`, `cancel_session_if_host_alone()`, `friendships_before_insert()`, and `friendships_before_update()` run as function owner to bypass RLS for cross-table locks/writes. Always paired with `SET search_path = public`.
- **Host is always a player** — DB triggers keep `sessions.host_id` in sync with `session_rsvps`. On session INSERT the host is auto-added with status='going'; if the host's RSVP transitions to 'cancelled' (or is deleted) and no other 'going' rows remain, the session auto-cancels.
- **Edge Functions for admin-only auth ops** — `supabase/functions/delete-account` uses the service-role key to call `auth.admin.deleteUser()` (not callable from Postgres/RLS). JWT is verified at the gateway (`verify_jwt = true`) and re-resolved in-function. Storage avatars are removed before the cascade fires.
- **Reusable Tabs primitive** — `src/components/Tabs.tsx` is an ARIA-correct tab strip (roles, `aria-selected`, Left/Right arrow nav, pill styling). Caller owns panel content. Profile page is the first consumer; pattern is ready for future tabbed surfaces.
- **Player search** — navbar search icon (auth-only) opens `PlayerSearchOverlay` (full-screen on mobile, centered panel on desktop, modeled on `Modal`'s a11y). `useProfileSearch` runs a debounced (`useDebouncedValue`), self-excluding, capped (8) **prefix** query: `username LIKE 'q%'` on a lowercased query, backed by the `profiles_username_prefix_idx` (`text_pattern_ops`) btree — relies on the existing `profiles_select_all` RLS, no RPC. Each result reuses the morphing `FriendActionButton`; the avatar + pills block is the shared `ProfileIdentity` (also used by `FriendRow`). LIKE wildcards in the query are escaped.

## Design workflow

- **HTML mockups before UI plans** — when planning how a feature looks (layout, placement, new screens), produce a self-contained HTML mockup under `design-mockups/` first, rendered in the real app theme (color tokens, fonts, pill/button styles), so layout choices can be reviewed visually before any plan is finalized or code is written. One file per feature (e.g. `design-mockups/friend-search.html`); show the realistic states, not just empty shells.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Scaffold (Vite + React + Tailwind + CI)~~ — PR #1
2. ~~Supabase schema (tables + RLS + triggers)~~ — PR #2
3. ~~Auth (email/password + Google/GitHub OAuth)~~ — PR #3
4. ~~Profiles (edit form + avatar upload)~~ — PR #4
5. ~~Map + Courts (Leaflet + Overpass + court detail)~~ — PR #5
6. ~~Sessions (host, list, detail, edit, cancel)~~ — PR #6
7. ~~RSVP system (roster UI, waitlist, session-full handling)~~ — PR #8
8. **Design polish** — in progress (PR #9)
9. ~~Password change + friendly error messages~~ — PR #13
10. ~~Active Sessions on profile + reusable Modal shell~~ — PR #14
11. ~~Roster redesign with player stat pills + hover profile card~~ — PR #15
12. ~~Fix: email verification callback no longer hangs (parses hash params, dispatches PKCE/OTP, adds timeout + error UI)~~ — PR #16
13. ~~Account deletion via danger zone + edge function (typed username confirmation, service-role hard delete, storage cleanup)~~ — PR #17
14. ~~Profile page redesign: sidebar identity + tabbed activity panel (Sessions / Friends / Settings); danger zone absorbed into Settings~~ — PR #18
15. ~~Map session panel: "Find a game" sidebar with upcoming-sessions list + filter toggle (sessions vs all courts); click a card to fly the map to that court~~ — PR #20
16. ~~Host auto-RSVP on session creation + solo-host-leaves auto-cancels the session (DB triggers + roster refresh wiring)~~ — PR #21
17. ~~"Currently Hooping" status surfaced across map markers, Find a game panel, court detail page, session detail header, roster, and profile sessions list (ticked live via `useNow`)~~ — PR #22
18. ~~Friends v1: request/accept friendship graph (`friendships` table + RLS + triggers), public `/u/:username` route, Friends tab (incoming callout / accepted / collapsed sent), quick-add affordances on PlayerHoverCard + map SessionCard host + SessionDetailPage host link~~ — PR #23
19. ~~Remove-friend confirmation: gate the destructive "Remove friend" action (FriendRow ✕ and FriendActionButton dropdown) behind a Yes/Cancel modal so accepted friendships aren't dropped by a misclick — decline-incoming and cancel-sent-request stay one-click~~ — PR #24
20. ~~Fix: `/u/:username` public profile route resolved "Profile not found." for mixed-case usernames (ProfileEditForm was persisting raw input while the lookup lowercased). Normalize at storage: backfill migration + `username = lower(username)` CHECK constraint + form lowercases on edit/submit~~ — PR #25
21. `/u/<self>` redirects to `/profile` so a signed-in user following a friend-of-friend chain back to themselves lands on the editable owner view (Edit / Replace photo / Settings / email) instead of the stripped public view — PR #26
22. Mobile-first responsive `FriendRow`: on narrow screens the request/sent rows stack (avatar + full username + pills on top, action buttons below) so the incoming Accept/Decline render as a full-width 50/50 split instead of cramming the username down to `@..`; collapses back to the original single line at `sm:`+. Accepted (✕) and public rows unchanged. — PR #27
23. Friend search: navbar search icon (auth-only) opens a `PlayerSearchOverlay` (full-screen mobile / centered desktop) with debounced search-as-you-type prefix matching on username, backed by a new `text_pattern_ops` index (`profiles_username_prefix_idx`); results exclude self, are capped at 8, and reuse the morphing `FriendActionButton` + a shared `ProfileIdentity` block (extracted from `FriendRow`). HTML mockup at `design-mockups/friend-search.html`. — PR #28
